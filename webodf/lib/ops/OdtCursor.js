/**
 * @class
 * A cursor is a dom node that visually represents a cursor in a DOM tree.
 * It should stay synchronized with the selection in the document. When
 * there is only one collapsed selection range, a cursor should be shown at
 * that point.
 *
 * Putting the cursor in the DOM tree modifies the DOM, so care should be taken
 * to keep the selection consistent. If e.g. a selection is drawn over the
 * cursor, and the cursor is updated to the selection, the cursor is removed
 * from the DOM because the selection is not collapsed. This means that the
 * offsets of the selection may have to be changed.
 *
 * When the selection is collapsed, the cursor is placed after the point of the
 * selection and the selection will stay valid. However, if the cursor was
 * placed in the DOM tree and was counted in the offset, the offset in the
 * selection should be decreased by one.
 *
 * Even when the selection allows for a cursor, it might be desireable to hide
 * the cursor by not letting it be part of the DOM.
